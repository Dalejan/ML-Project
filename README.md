# ML-Project
Simple project with supervised ML algorithms to predict using regresion (or clasification) 


### How to contribute
This project use the gitflow strategy (master>develop>features/hotfix...).  
Pushing a new feature will open a PR (Pull Request) that will be open until the crew check it and approve it to merge or deny it.

The strategy to merge a Pull Request is **Squash and Merge**. So only the title of the PR will be taken as commit in the develop branch.

To merge into master you should manually create a PR with `base:master` and `compare:develop` so the commits in develop will be merged into master. This should be done once a week minimum.
